This module provides a very flexible interface for interacting with the [CS:GO](http://store.steampowered.com/app/730)
Game Coordinator. It's designed to work with a
[node-steam-user SteamUser](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user) instance.

This is based off of [node-tf2](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-tf2).

**You will need node-steam-user v4.2.0 or later and Node.js v8 or later to use node-globaloffensive v2.**

# Setup

First, install it from npm:

	$ npm install globaloffensive

Require the module and call its constructor with your SteamUser instance:

```js
const SteamUser = require('steam-user');
const GlobalOffensive = require('globaloffensive');

let user = new SteamUser();
let csgo = new GlobalOffensive(user);
```

To initialize your GC connection, just launch CS:GO via SteamUser normally:

```js
client.gamesPlayed([730]);
```

node-globaloffensive will emit a `connectedToGC` event when the game coordinator connection has been successfully
established. You shouldn't try to do anything before you receive that event.

# Enums

There are some enums that are used by various methods and events. You can find them in `enums.js`.

# Properties

There are a few useful read-only properties available to you.

### haveGCSession

`true` if we're currently connected to the GC, `false` otherwise. You should only call methods when we have an active GC session.

### accountData

- `my_current_event_teams` - Always an empty array?
- `my_current_event_stages` - Always an empty array?
- `rankings` - Always an empty array?
- `account_id`
- `ongoingmatch`
- `global_stats`
    - `search_statistics` - Array of MM queues with info
        - `game_type` 
        - `search_time_avg` - Always `null`?

### inventory

An array containing the items in your inventory. Undefined until `connectedToGC` is emitted.

As of v2.2.0, some special properties are populated on items in this array (and also item objects in `itemAcquired` and
related events), where applicable:

- `position` - This item's position in your inventory. If the item is new and unacknowledged, this is `0`
- `custom_name` - This item's custom name, applied via name tag
- `paint_index` - The item's paint index
- `paint_seed` - The item's paint seed
- `paint_wear` - The item's paint wear, as a float (often ignorantly referred to as "float value")
- `kill_eater_value` - Tracked stat value for StatTrak weapons
- `kill_eater_score_type` - What type of stat is tracked for StatTrak weapons. Currently only 0 (Kills) is available.
- `quest_id`
- `tradable_after` - A `Date` object representing when this item will become tradable. May be a date in the past, as this is not removed when the date is reached.
- `stickers` - An array of objects:
    - `slot` - The sticker slot number, 0-5
    - `sticker_id`
    - `wear` - The sticker's wear (how scratched it is), as a float. `null` if not scratched at all.
    - `scale` - Float, `null` if not applicable
    - `rotation` - Float, `null` if not applicable
- `casket_id` - If this item is contained in a casket (storage unit), this is a string containing that casket's item ID
- `casket_contained_item_count` - If this item is a casket (storage unit), this is a count of how many items it contains

Note that if any of the above attributes are not applicable, then they will not exist in the item object.

It appears that under some circumstances, the GC might load items from storage units into your inventory without
calling [`getCasketContents`](#getcasketcontentscasketid-callback), so if you are using this property to see what items
are in your inventory, you will need to check `casket_id` to filter out items stored in storage units.

# Methods

### Constructor(steamClient)

When instantiating your node-globaloffensive instance, you need to pass your active Steam.SteamClient instance as the sole parameter, as shown here:

```js
var csgo = new GlobalOffensive(steamClient);
```

### requestMatchmakingStats()

Requests the GC for matchmaking data.
Listen for the `accountData` event to get your response or access the [accountData](#accountdata) propery after `accountData` was emitted

### requestGame(shareCodeOrDetails)
- `shareCodeOrDetails` - Either a share code as a string, or an object containing properties `matchId`, `outcomeId`, `token`

**v2.2.0 or later is required to use this method**

Requests stats for a historical game. Listen for the `matchList` event to get your response.

### requestLiveGames()

Request a list of current live tournament games.
This is the list you see in the client under Watch -> Live.
Listen for the `matchList` event to get your response.

### requestRecentGames(steamid)

Request a list of recent games (max. 8). This is the list you see in the client under Watch -> Your Matches.
Listen for the `matchList` event to get your response.

### requestLiveGameForUser(steamid)

Request live game info for a specific user. Listen for the `matchList` event to get your response.

### inspectItem(owner[, assetid][, d][, callback])
- `owner` - The numeric SteamID or market listing ID of the owning Steam account or market listing, as a string; or an entire inspect link.
- `assetid` - If `owner` is not an entire inspect link, this is the numeric asset ID of this item, as a string
- `d` - If `owner` is not an entire inspect link, this is the "D" number from the inspect link (the last number following the "D" character)
- `callback` - Optional. Called if all parameters are valid when Steam responds to us.
	- `item` - An object containing the item's data

**v1.1.0 or later is required to use this method**

Sends the same request to the GC that the official client sends when you inspect an item. If all parameters are correct
and the GC is in a good mood, returns the item's data. Using this for an item your account owns is useless as all
the data is already available in `inventory`.

The response will arrive in the callback and in the `inspectItemInfo` event.

As of v2.1.0, the request will time out if no response is received in 10 seconds. If this happens,
[`inspectItemTimedOut`](#inspectitemtimedout) will be emitted.

**v1.2.0 or later is required to use this method**

Sends the same request to the GC that viewing the CSGO player profile from the in-game friendlist sends. Returns the same information that you would get in-game.
This returns the same protobuf that is used when you request your own profile data, so most of it stays empty.

### nameItem(nameTagId, itemId, name)
- `nameTagId` - The ID of the name tag you want to consume to do this
- `itemId` - The ID of the item you want to rename
- `name` - A string containing the item's new name

**v2.1.0 or later is required to use this method**

Renames a particular item in your inventory, using a given name tag. You can rename storage units for free by passing
`0` as the `nameTagId`.

### deleteItem(itemId)
- `itemId` - The ID of the item you want to delete

**1.3.0 or later is required to use this method**

Deletes a particular item from your inventory. **This is a destructive operation, which cannot be undone.**

### addToCasket(casketId, itemId)
- `casketId` - The ID of the casket (storage unit) you want to put an item into
- `itemId` - The ID of the item you want to put into the casket

**v2.1.0 or later is required to use this method**

Put an item in your inventory into a casket (storage unit) you own. Assuming the request succeeds,
[`itemRemoved`](#itemremoved) will be emitted for the item that was put into the casket, and
[`itemCustomizationNotification`](#itemcustomizationnotification) will be emitted with notification type
`CasketAdded` for the casket.

### removeFromCasket(casketId, itemId)
- `casketId` - The ID of the casket (storage unit) you want to remove an item from
- `itemId` - The ID of the item you want to remove from the casket

**v2.1.0 or later is required to use this method**

Remove an item from a casket (storage unit) you own and put it into your inventory. Assuming the request succeeds,
[`itemAcquired`](#itemremoved) will be emitted for the item that was removed from the casket, and
[`itemCustomizationNotification`](#itemcustomizationnotification) will be emitted with notification type
`CasketRemoved` for the casket.

### getCasketContents(casketId, callback)
- `casketId` - The ID of the casket (storage unit) you want to get the contents of
- `callback` - A function to be called once the contents are loaded
    - `err` - An `Error` object on failure, or `null` on success
    - `items` - An array of item objects, the same structure as objects in [`inventory`](#inventory)

**v2.1.0 or later is required to use this method**

Loads the contents of a storage unit. Note that calling this will have the GC load the contents of the storage unit
using the same mechanism as your actual inventory, so items in the storage unit will appear in the [`inventory`](#inventory)
property, and `itemAcquired` will be emitted for each item. Each item in your [`inventory`](#inventory) that is contained
inside of a storage unit has a property `casket_id`, the value of which is a string containing the ID of the storage unit
that contains that item.

It appears that under some circumstances, the GC might load these items into your inventory without calling this method,
so if you are using [`inventory`](#inventory) to see what items are in your inventory, you will need to check `casket_id`
to filter out items stored in storage units.
	
# Events

### connectedToGC

Emitted when a GC connection is established. You shouldn't use any methods before you receive this. Note that this may be received (after it's first emitted) without any disconnectedFromGC event being emitted. In this case, the GC simply restarted.
