This module provides a very flexible interface for interacting with the [CS:GO](http://store.steampowered.com/app/730)
Game Coordinator. It's designed to work with a
[node-steam SteamUser](https://github.com/seishun/node-steam/tree/master/lib/handlers/user) or
[node-steam-user SteamUser](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user) instance.

This is based off of [node-tf2](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-tf2).

# Setup

First, install it from npm:

	$ npm install globaloffensive

Require the module and call its constructor with your SteamUser instance:

```js
var Steam = require('steam');
var GlobalOffensive = require('globaloffensive');

var client = new Steam.SteamClient();
var user = new Steam.SteamUser(client);
var csgo = new GlobalOffensive(user);
```

or

```js
var SteamUser = require('steam-user');
var GlobalOffensive = require('globaloffensive');

var user = new SteamUser();
var csgo = new GlobalOffensive(user);
```

To initialize your GC connection, just launch CS:GO via SteamUser normally:

```js
client.gamesPlayed([730]);
```

node-globaloffensive will emit a `connectedToGC` event when the game coordinator connection has been successfully
established. You shouldn't try to do anything before you receive that event.

# Enums

There are some enums that are used by various methods and events. You can find them in `enums.js`.

# Properties

There are a few useful read-only properties available to you.

### haveGCSession

`true` if we're currently connected to the GC, `false` otherwise. You should only call methods when we have an active GC session.

### accountData

A big object containing account data and some statistics including players in-game. Undefined until `accountData` is emitted.

### inventory

An array containing the items in your inventory. Undefined until `connectedToGC` is emitted.

# Methods

### Constructor(steamClient)

When instantiating your node-globaloffensive instance, you need to pass your active Steam.SteamClient instance as the sole parameter, as shown here:

```js
var csgo = new GlobalOffensive(steamClient);
```

### requestLiveGames()

Request a list of current live tournament games. This is the list you see in the client under Watch -> Live. Listen for the `matchList` event to get your response.

### inspectItem(owner[, assetid][, d][, callback])
- `owner` - The numeric SteamID or market listing ID of the owning Steam account or market listing, as a string; or an entire inspect link.
- `assetid` - If `owner` is not an entire inspect link, this is the numeric asset ID of this item, as a string
- `d` - If `owner` is not an entire inspect link, this is the "D" number from the inspect link (the last number following the "D" character)
- `callback` - Optional. Called if all parameters are valid when Steam responds to us.
    - `item` - An object containing the item's data
        - `accountid` - Seems to always be `null`
        - `itemid` - The item's asset ID, as a string
        - `defindex` - The item's definition index
        - `paintindex` - The item's paint index
        - `rarity` - The item's numeric rarity
        - `quality` - The item's numeric quality
        - `paintwear` - The item's paint wear percentage, as a float between 0 and 1 (frequently and incorrectly called "float value")
        - `paintseed` - The item's paint seed
        - `killeaterscoretype` - What kind of statistic the StatTrak version of this item tracks (may be `null` if not StatTrak)
        - `killeatervalue` - The item's tracked statistic value (kills)
        - `customname` - The item's custom name via a name tag, or `null` if none
        - `stickers` - An array of objects describing the stickers applied to this item
            - `slot` - What slot this sticker is applied to
            - `stickerId` - The ID of this type of sticker
            - `wear` - Either `null` (not scratched) or a float between 0 and 1 describing how much this sticker has been scratched
            - `scale` - Always `null`?
            - `rotation` - Always `null`?
        - `inventory` - An integer which has no use to you
        - `origin` - The numeric origin of this item
        - `questid` - You can ignore this

**v1.1.0 or later is required to use this method**

Sends the same request to the GC that the official client sends when you inspect an item. If all parameters are correct
and the GC is in a good mood, returns the item's data. Using this for an item your account owns is useless as all
the data is already available in `inventory`.

The response will arrive in the callback and in the `inspectItemInfo` event.

### requestPlayersProfile(steamid[, callback])
- `steamid` - The numeric SteamID of the Steam account to pull profile data for. Needs to be playing CSGO and be on the friend list of the requesting account.
- `callback` - Optional. Called if all parameters are valid when Steam responds to us.
    - `profile` - An object containing the profiledata
        - `accountid` - Steam account id
	- `ongoingmatch`
	- `globalStats` - Seems to always be `null`
	- `penaltySeconds`
	- `penaltyReason`
	- `vacBanned`
	- `ranking`
	    - `accountid`
	    - `rankId` - Matchmaking rank (0-18), starting at 0 for unranked
	    - `wins` - Number of matchmaking wins
	    - `rankChange` - Seems to always be `null`
	- `commendation`
	    - `cmdFriendly` - The number of "friendly" commendations the account has received
	    - `cmdTeaching` - The number of "teaching" commendations the account has received
	    - `cmdLeader` - The number of "leader" commendations the account has received
	- `medals` - Archievement medals, their ranks and coins
	    - `medalTeam`
	    - `medalCombat`
	    - `medalWeapon`
	    - `medalGlobal`
	    - `medalArms`
	    - `legacy_CoinOpPayback`
	    - `displayedItemsDefidx` - Array of coins
	    - `featuredDisplayItemDefidx`
	- `myCurrentEvent`
	- `myCurrentEventTeams`
	- `myCurrentTeam`
	- `myCurrentEventStages`
	- `surveyVote`
	- `activity`
	- `secondsUntilNextMission`
	
**v1.2.0 or later is required to use this method**

Sends the same request to the GC that viewing the CSGO player profile from the in-game friendlist sends. Returns the same information that you would get in-game.
This returns the same protobuf that is used when you request your own profile data, so most of it stays empty.
	
# Events

### connectedToGC

Emitted when a GC connection is established. You shouldn't use any methods before you receive this. Note that this may be received (after it's first emitted) without any disconnectedFromGC event being emitted. In this case, the GC simply restarted.

### disconnectedFromGC
- `reason` - A value from the `GCConnectionStatus` enum

Emitted when we're disconnected from the GC for any reason. node-globaloffensive will automatically try to reconnect and will emit `connectedToGC` when reconnected.

### connectionStatus
- `status` - A value from the `GCConnectionStatus` enum
- `data` - The raw data that was received

Emitted when we receive the status of our connection to the GC. Exactly when this is emitted is currently unknown. **This may be removed in the future.**

### matchList
- `matches` - An array of matches
